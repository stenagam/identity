([este documento em PortuguÃªs](LEIAME.md))

## info needed on all examples:

The samples expect a `.env` file containing this data. You can copy the `.env.example` file from the
root folder to the desired sample folder, renaming it to `.env`,  and fill in the blanks.

```shell
cp .env-example deno/.env # copy sample file renaming it
code deno/.env # open the file for editing it on vscode
```
